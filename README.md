# OpsWorks CLI

The Command Line Interface you wish Amazon shipped for OpsWorks.

## Installation

	npm install -g opsworks-cli

## Usage

### Check dat stack

This will list the layers in a stack

	opsworks describe [stack]

### List layer instances

This will list the instances in a layer

	opsworks list [stack] [layer]

### Add  some instances

You can use `opsworks-cli` to quickly add instances to a layer.  The basic syntax is:

	opsworks add [stack] [layer]

#### Add instances across all Availability Zone's

The `opsworks add` command provides a flexible way to create new instances.

	opsworks add my_stack my_layer --count 6 --size c3.large --prefix hostname_prefix --distribute --start

This command will create *and start* (via the --start flag) 6 new instances across the layer's Availability Zone's (via the --distribute flag).
Instance hostnames are the concatenation of the `prefix` argument and the number of the created instance.

For example, running the above in **us-east** will result in the following instances being spawned:

	hostname_prefix-0	c3.large	us-east-1a
	hostname_prefix-1	c3.large	us-east-1b
	hostname_prefix-2	c3.large	us-east-1d
	hostname_prefix-3	c3.large	us-east-1a
	hostname_prefix-4	c3.large	us-east-1b
	hostname_prefix-5	c3.large	us-east-1d

### SSH

`opsworks ssh` provides the ability to SSH into one or more instances.  This works by starting a `tmux` session, which must be available on your system.

Most Linux distributions come with tmux installed; There is a Homebrew formula available for OS X:

	OS X	brew install tmux

#### Connect to a single instance

	opsworks ssh my_stack my_layer -h my_instance_hostname

#### Connecting to an entire layer

This will create a multi-pane `tmux` session.

	opsworks ssh my_stack my_layer

#### Configuring private key authentication

`config.json`, located in the install path of this module contains a default SSH key location. You may choose to change this:

	opsworks config ssh.identity ~/.ssh/my_favorite_key

or supply a key manually (this will override the default key specified in `config.json`):

	opsworks ssh my_stack my_layer -i ~/.ssh/my_other_key


### Stopping instances

`opsworks stop` provides a way to stop instances.  Stopped instances are *not* automatically deleted, see `opsworks delete` if you seek that functionality.
There are two methods of stopping instances.  You can stop all instances in a layer, or instances target by a prefix filter.

#### Stopping all instances in a layer

	opsworks stop my_stack my_layer --all

#### Stopping instances matching a prefix

In the case where you may be looking to shut down all instances running some old software, being able to target them by a git ref or similar identifier makes this extremely easy.

	opsworks stop my_stack my_layer --prefix git_6e84r37

### Deleting instances

Only stopped instances can be deleted.  Similar to stopping, you can delete instances matching a prefix or all instances in a layer.

#### Deleting all stopped instances in a layer

	opsworks delete my_stack my_layer --all-stopped

#### Deleting instances matching a prefix

	opsworks delete my_stack my_layer --prefix git_6e84r37
